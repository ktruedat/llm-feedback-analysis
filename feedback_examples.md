## 🌟 Strongly Positive

1. The performance improvements in this release are massive. Everything feels snappy again.
2. One of the cleanest UIs I’ve seen in a dev tool. Thoughtful design everywhere.
3. Rock-solid stability so far. Zero crashes since the update.
4. This update finally fixed all the annoyances I had. The app feels polished now.
5. Honestly one of the best-designed products I’ve used this year. Great job.

## 🙂 Mildly Positive

1. Overall a nice update. Things feel smoother, even if some changes are subtle.
2. Good progress. The memory usage is better than before, at least on my machine.
3. The new features are useful, but they don’t get in the way of my workflow.

## 😐 Neutral

1. It does what it’s supposed to do. No major issues, no major improvements either.
2. Seems fine so far. I haven’t noticed anything significantly better or worse.

## 🤔 Mixed Feelings

1. The UI looks cleaner, but the app definitely uses more RAM now.
2. Some performance gains, but random freezes still happen occasionally.
3. Love the new functionality, hate how slow startup has become.

---

## 🛠 Constructive / Critical but Calm

1. Memory usage slowly increases over time—might be worth checking for leaks.
2. Syntax highlighting sometimes breaks in larger files, especially with Rust.
3. The app is powerful, but better optimization would really improve the experience.
4. Crashes are rare, but when they happen there’s no useful error message.

## 😤 Frustrated

1. RAM consumption is getting out of control. I have to restart it every few hours.
2. Random crashes during indexing are killing my productivity.
3. Basic features feel slower with every update.

---

## 😡 Angry

1. This update completely broke my workflow. Constant freezes and crashes.
2. Unacceptable memory usage for a tool that used to be lightweight.
3. Feels like performance testing was skipped entirely.

---

## 😏 Sarcastic

1. Rust support is fantastic, if you enjoy waiting five minutes for syntax highlighting to load.
2. Congrats on the new features—too bad the app barely stays open now.

---

## 😢 Emotional / Disappointed

1. I really loved this product, but it’s becoming harder to rely on.
2. It hurts to say this, but the tool I trusted every day now feels unstable.
3. Rust support feels half-baked compared to Go or Python.
